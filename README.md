Titanic Survival Predict using machine learning techniques.

I used the class in which the passengers had a ticket and the gender of the passengers previously mapped as the attributes needed to predict survival. 

I decided to use:
* Random Forest Classifier.
* Decision Tree Classifier. 

I obtained 76% acccuracy with both models.
